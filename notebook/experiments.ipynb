Maybe list a few examples like Weather.com or AccuWeather. Also, mention that Bangalore typically has a tropical savanna climate, which means hot and dry during certain months and some rain in others. It's good to give a general idea based on the season, but I should avoid specific details since I don't have current data.\n",

Make sure the response is friendly and helpful, guiding them to the right resources. Let me structure that clearly without being too technical. Double-check that I'm not making up any specific temperature or conditions. Keep it straightforward and honest about the limitations. Alright, that should cover it.\n",
